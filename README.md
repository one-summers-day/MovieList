# Movie List

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo, then open two terminal tabs and navigate to the root directory.

2. In one of the two seperate terminal tabs run the following script:
  ```
  npm start
  ```

3. In the second terminal tab run:
  ```
  npm run react-dev
  ```

4. Open localhost:3000 in the browser and you should see **Hello World!** if React is running correctly.

Now you can get started building the application by visiting gLearn and following the next instructions there.

## Level 0

1. A movieList element should correspond to a react component. The movieList, therefore, is a react component of react components.

2. Iterate through ```movies``` and hardcode them.

## Level 1

1. Make a searchbar using some HTML inside a react component.

2. Add an eventListener (make the button stateful) so when it is triggered, only those react elements with matching names are displayed.

* Add an extra clause to 2 to catch cases where there are no such react elements with the given movie name
